# Velvet Generator 

The generator works with the velvet_annotation package to generate code.

See the example in the [velvet_annotation](https://github.com/dedecube/velvet/tree/main/packages/velvet_annotation/example/README.md) package.

The generator not only exports velvet generators and builders but also wraps vendored generators and builders in build.yaml. (riverpod, freezed, go_router, json_serializable).

So you can use the vendored generators and builders without adding them to your pubspec.yaml.
